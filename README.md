### I'm a not-so-undercover nerd who always breaks cover whenever talking about statistics and data science, product, or finance. 

I'm passionate about enabling business by building products that users and user data demand.

I work as a product analyst because I care about driving business growth by building products that users love; my data science background underpins my data-driven decision-making. However, I also recognize that data alone will not tell me what users need --talking with users is necessary to understand the problem space.

I have experience in machine learning (esp. regressions and cluster analysis), A/B testing, financial modeling, building data products, tracking product/feature usage, creating mockups, defining product requirements, various econometric methods, and presenting the derivatives of each of those experiences to senior leadership.
